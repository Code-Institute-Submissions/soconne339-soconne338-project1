# How To — A page about LifeHacks

This project is a single-page website showing the main lifehack categories and lifehacks inside. The page features four different lifehack categories: Computer hacks, cleaning hacks, household hacks and food hacks. I’ve considered these lifehack categories as they are the main subject in our daily lives. 

# UX Design
 
The goal of this website is to provide the user with ways to improve the simple tasks carried out on a daily basis. The information is presented in a simple manner whereby the user can find the category for the hack he wishes to find, he can click on it and then be brought to the information. If the user wants to explore a new area, the UI is designed to allow him to click on a button and be immediately brought to the navigation menu.

I designed this page with UX in mind. The buttons for each category is designed with large text and with a large target area. The user can easily click or tap and they are brought to the relevant location on the page.

 Information is presented in chunks as this allows the user to see the information clearly. The colours are chosen purposefully for UX. Having a high contrast in the title (white against brown) draws the users' focus. The text is semi-bold as this makes it easier to read.
 
# The ideal client for this business is:

* English speaking
* Someone who is in the age group of 20-30
* Someone who is looking for ways to improve their productivity and speed at which tasks are carried out.
 
# Scope
I included the following features in the website:

Signup form added at the bottom to allow the user to receive lifehacks via email.

 
# Skeleton
 
This website is a single-page website and users can access the required information without having to wait for the page to reload.
